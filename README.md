## I'm a software architect/manager/engineer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on re-doing my github stuff. (I emptied it out a couple of years ago when I worked for a company that wasn't keen on us doing open source.) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and iOS development, starting to dabble with Rust, and giving myself a refresher course on Go and Python.
- ðŸ¥… 2020 Goals: learn a lot, finish writing my current novel, write more blogs, and meet interesting people.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the organizer or co-organizer of three Pittsburgh-area meetup groups: [board games](https://www.meetup.com/Board-Gaming-Geeks), [pittsburgh writers](https://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-writers-meetup/), and [non-fiction round table](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-NonFiction-Round-Table/).

### Languages, Tools, Databases:

Note: I never claim to be an expert in a language (or anything else). So I'll try to distinguish between the things I've used at work "for real" versus things I've written personal projects in, versus things I'm curious about and learning.

That said, some of these are things I used a lot many years ago, while others are things I used a little very recently.

## Languages

### Used for real
- c, c++, css, go, html, java, javascript, perl, php, python, ruby, swift, typescript

### Used for personal projects, or just learning
- clojure, elixir, rust

## Tools, Frameworks, Formats, etc.

### Used for real
- atom, intellij (and jetbrains family), vim, vscode, xcode
- git (and many other version control systems), confluence, jira, trello, ...
- docker, kubernetes
- html, json, yaml, xml
- bootstrap, d3, rails, react, redux, spring

### Used for personal projects, or just learning

## Databases/Datastores

### Used for real
- cassandra, dgraph, mysql, oracle, postgresql, redis, scylladb

### Used for personal projects, or just learning
- mongodb, neo4j

# Things I didn't put here

1. bash - I use it all the time, but if I'm going to write a script I'll use python, ruby, perl, ...
2. xslt - I just don't like it
3. lisp - a first love, but alas
4. things we used at work but I never programmed, like elasticsearch, etc.
