## I'm a software architect/manager/engineer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on re-doing my github stuff. (I emptied it out a couple of years ago when I worked for a company that wasn't keen on us doing open source.) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift and iOS development, starting to dabble with Rust, and giving myself a refresher course on Go and Python.
- ðŸ¥… 2020 Goals: learn a lot, finish writing my current novel, write more blogs, and meet interesting people.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm the organizer or co-organizer of three Pittsburgh-area meetup groups: [board games](https://www.meetup.com/Board-Gaming-Geeks), [pittsburgh writers](https://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-writers-meetup/), and [non-fiction round table](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-NonFiction-Round-Table/).
