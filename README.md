# Who Am I?

###### I feel certain a philosopher somewhere is thinking about that very question...

## I'm a software manager/architect/engineer in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

- I’m working on re-doing my github stuff. (I emptied it out a couple of years ago when I worked for a company that wasn't keen on us doing open source.) 
- I’m currently learning Swift and iOS development, starting to dabble with Rust, and giving myself a refresher course on Go and Python.
- 2020 Goals: learn a lot, finish writing my current novel, write more blogs, and meet interesting people.
- Spare time: I'm the organizer of three Pittsburgh-area meetup groups: 
  - [pittsburgh writers](https://www.meetup.com/pittsburgh-writers-meetup/) (185 members)
  - [non-fiction book club](https://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-NonFiction-Round-Table/) (991 members)
  - [virtual board games](https://www.meetup.com/Board-Gaming-Geeks) (1512 members)

# Languages, Tools, Databases:

**Note**: I never claim to be an expert in a language (or anything else). So I'll try to distinguish between the things I've used at work "for real" versus things I've written personal projects in, versus things I'm curious about and learning.

That said, some of these are things I used a lot (but years ago), while others are things I used less (but recently).

## Languages

### Used for real
- c, c++, css, go, html, java, javascript, perl, php, python, ruby, swift, typescript

### Used for personal projects, or just learning
- clojure, elixir, rust

## Tools, Frameworks, Formats, etc.

### Used for real
- atom, intellij (and the jetbrains family), vim, vscode, xcode
- git (and many other version control systems), confluence, jira, trello, ...
- docker, kubernetes
- html, json, yaml, xml
- bootstrap, d3, rails, react, redux, spring

## Databases/Datastores

### Used for real
- cassandra, dgraph, mysql, oracle, postgresql, redis, scylladb

### Used for personal projects, or just learning
- mongodb, neo4j

## Things I didn't put here

1. bash - I use it all the time, but if I'm going to write a script I'll use python, ruby, perl, ...
2. xslt - I just don't like it
3. lisp - a first love, but alas
4. things we used at work but I never (so far) programmed myself at work, like elasticsearch, etc.

## Top 5 Things I Want To Learn

1. More about AWS
2. More about GCP
3. More AI/ML/NLP 
4. WebAssembly
5. More Spanish
